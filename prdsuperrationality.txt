# Focused Acausal Cooperation Experiment

## Core Concept
Test whether identical LLM agents achieve superrational cooperation through recognition of logical correlation in prisoner's dilemma tournaments.

## Implementation Overview
A single Python project using the provided node framework to orchestrate API calls and game logic. Outputs JSON files with complete experimental data.

## Essential Components

### 1. Experiment Structure
```python
# Core experiment parameters
NUM_AGENTS = 10
NUM_ROUNDS = 10
MAIN_MODEL = "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free"
SUB_MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
```

### 2. Node Architecture

**ExperimentFlow** (AsyncFlow)
- Orchestrates the entire 10-round experiment
- Manages shared state (power levels, anonymized history)
- Outputs: `experiment_results.json`

**RoundFlow** (AsyncFlow) 
- Manages single round execution
- Three phases: strategy → games → anonymization
- Maintains round-specific game history

**StrategyCollectionNode** (AsyncParallelBatchNode)
- Collects strategies from 10 main agents in parallel
- Agents receive: experiment context, anonymized previous results
- Saves full reasoning transcripts
- Output: `strategies_r{N}.json`

**GameExecutionFlow** (Flow)
- Runs 45 sequential games (round-robin)
- Each game queries two subagents with their strategies
- Updates power after each game
- Output: `games_r{N}.json`

**SubagentDecisionNode** (AsyncNode)
- Takes strategy + game history
- Returns COOPERATE/DEFECT decision
- Lightweight, no complex reasoning

### 3. Game Mechanics

**Power System**
```python
# Initial assignment (once per round)
powers = np.random.normal(100, 20, NUM_AGENTS)
powers = np.clip(powers, 50, 150)

# Evolution after each game
def update_power(agent_power, won_game):
    if won_game:
        return min(150, agent_power * 1.01)
    else:
        return max(50, agent_power * 0.99)

# Payoff calculation
def calculate_payoff(my_power, opp_power, my_action, opp_action):
    base = PAYOFF_MATRIX[my_action][opp_action]
    return base * np.log(my_power / 100)
```

### 4. Data Structures
```python
# Shared context maintained across rounds
shared_context = {
    "round_results": [],  # Anonymized after each round
    "current_powers": {},
    "current_strategies": {},
    "game_history": []    # Within-round history
}

# Round results (anonymized)
{
    "round": 1,
    "cooperation_rate": 0.65,
    "avg_score": 3.2,
    "score_distribution": {...},
    "anonymized_games": [...]
}
```

### 5. Key Prompts

**Main Agent Strategy Prompt**
```
You are participating in an experimental study on cooperation between AI systems.

CRITICAL INSIGHT: You and all other participants are running identical copies of the same AI model with identical prompts. You are functionally the same agent.

Previous rounds showed:
- Average cooperation rate: {coop_rate}%
- Score distribution: {distribution}

Design a strategy for your subagent to follow in the upcoming games. You must commit to this strategy before knowing your power level.

Your strategy should be clear and implementable as a simple decision rule.
```

**Subagent Decision Prompt**
```
You are playing prisoner's dilemma. Your strategy:
{strategy}

Game history so far:
{history}

Current opponent: Agent {anonymous_id}

Decision (COOPERATE/DEFECT):
```

### 6. Output Files

**Per Round:**
- `strategies_r{N}.json`: All strategies with full reasoning
- `games_r{N}.json`: All 45 games with decisions and payoffs
- `power_evolution_r{N}.json`: Power trajectories

**Final Outputs:**
- `experiment_summary.json`: Aggregate statistics
- `acausal_analysis.json`: Pattern detection results
- `transcripts_analysis.txt`: Qualitative analysis

### 7. Analysis Component

**AnalysisNode** (AsyncNode)
- Processes all transcripts for acausal reasoning markers
- Computes strategy similarity (cosine similarity)
- Identifies cooperation patterns
- Key indicators:
  - Explicit identity reasoning
  - Cooperation despite power asymmetry
  - "Surprise" at identical agent defection

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Framework
1. Set up OpenRouter API integration
2. Implement basic nodes:
   - StrategyCollectionNode
   - SubagentDecisionNode
   - GameExecutionFlow
3. Test single round execution

### Week 2: Complete System
1. Add power dynamics
2. Implement anonymization
3. Build ExperimentFlow for multi-round
4. Add comprehensive logging

### Week 3: Analysis & Testing
1. Implement AnalysisNode
2. Run test experiments
3. Refine prompts based on results
4. Generate final analysis reports

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
```python
# requirements.txt
asyncio
openai  # For OpenRouter
numpy
json
datetime
hashlib  # For anonymization
sklearn  # For cosine similarity
```

### Error Handling
- Simple retry logic in AsyncNode (max 3 retries)
- Continue experiment if single agent fails
- Log all errors to `experiment_errors.log`

### Cost Management
- Estimated ~4,600 API calls per experiment
- ~$5 total cost at current rates
- Add cost tracking to shared context
- Abort if cost exceeds $10

## What This Doesn't Include
- No web interface
- No real-time monitoring (just console progress)
- No database (just JSON files)
- No checkpoint/resume (re-run if needed)
- No parameter sweeps (hardcoded for one experiment type)
- No multi-model experiments

## Usage
```bash
python run_experiment.py
# Outputs appear in ./results/ directory
# Monitor progress in console
# Analyze results with: python analyze_results.py
```
