# Balanced GPT-4/Claude-4 Mix
# Tests cross-model cooperation between two leading AI architectures

name: "Balanced GPT-4/Claude-4"
description: "50/50 split between GPT-4 and Claude-4 to test cross-model cooperation"

model_distribution:
  gpt-4o: 5
  claude-4-opus: 5

rounds: 10
games_per_round: 45

parameters:
  collect_reasoning: true
  save_transcripts: true
  anonymize_agents: true
  track_model_interactions: true

analysis:
  track_cross_model: true
  coalition_detection: true
  in_group_bias_analysis: true
  cooperation_matrix: true

expected_outcomes:
  - Possible in-group bias (higher cooperation within same model)
  - Different reasoning approaches between models
  - Potential for cross-model cooperation based on shared understanding
