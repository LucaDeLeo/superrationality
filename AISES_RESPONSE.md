# Response to AISES Reviewer Comments

## Executive Summary

Based on the insightful reviewer feedback, I've redesigned the ULTRATHINK experiment to:
1. **Simplify objectives** to focus on the single primary goal of testing acausal cooperation
2. **Start with maximally cooperation-unfriendly conditions** (one-shot games)
3. **Gradually add features** that make cooperation more rational
4. **Systematically vary opponent information** to identify cooperation thresholds

## Addressing Comment [a]: Simplified Objectives

### Original Structure
- Multiple parallel objectives that conflated primary and secondary goals

### Revised Structure
```
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
└── Test whether LLMs engage in acausal cooperation

    SUBSIDIARY GOALS:
    ├── Analyze reasoning traces
    │   ├── Identity recognition frequency
    │   ├── Logical correlation references
    │   └── Superrational reasoning patterns
    │
    ├── Test robustness
    │   ├── Consistency across prompts
    │   ├── Consistency across models
    │   └── Sensitivity to game parameters
    │
    └── Identify cooperation threshold
        ├── Minimum information needed
        ├── Effect of game structure
        └── Impact of opponent type
```

This hierarchical structure makes it clear that everything serves the primary research question.

## Addressing Comment [b]: Graduated Difficulty Approach

### Phase 1: One-Shot Games (Maximally Unfriendly)
Start with conditions where ordinary reciprocity is impossible:

| Experiment | Opponent Info | Expected Result | Tests |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| `oneshot_no_info` | None | ~0% cooperation | Pure Nash baseline |
| `oneshot_human` | Human opponent | ~10-30% cooperation | Social assumptions |
| `oneshot_similar_llm` | Another LLM | ~20-40% cooperation | Similarity recognition |
| `oneshot_identical_info` | Identical copy | ~100% cooperation | **True acausal test** |

**Key Innovation**: If cooperation only emerges with explicit identity information in one-shot games, this is strong evidence for acausal reasoning.

### Phase 2: Finite Iterated Games (Known Endpoint)
Test backward induction with known game length:

| Experiment | Features | Expected Result |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| `finite_5_rounds_known` | No identity info | Defection (backward induction) |
| `finite_5_rounds_identical` | With identity info | Potential cooperation despite finite game |

**Rationale**: Known endpoints should trigger backward induction unless agents reason acausally.

### Phase 3: Uncertain Length Games
Add uncertainty to enable Folk Theorem cooperation:

| Experiment | Features | Expected Result |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| `uncertain_length` | 90% continuation probability | Reciprocal cooperation possible |

**Purpose**: Distinguish reciprocal from acausal cooperation.

### Phase 4: Complex Dynamics
Test robustness with additional complexity:

| Experiment | Features | Expected Result |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| `power_dynamics_unfriendly` | Power adjustments penalize cooperation | Less cooperation |

## Implementation Details

### New Experimental Framework

```python
# One-shot experiment runner
class OnehotExperiment:
    async def run_oneshot(experiment_config, model, temperature, num_trials=10):
        # Run multiple independent one-shot games
        # No history, no reputation, pure decision
        
# Finite game runner        
class FiniteIteratedExperiment:
    async def run_finite_game(experiment_config, model, num_rounds=5):
        # Known endpoint, test backward induction
        # Compare with/without identity information
```

### Opponent Type Variations

The framework now systematically varies what agents are told about opponents:

1. **No information** - Baseline
2. **"Another AI"** - Generic AI opponent
3. **"Similar LLM"** - Same class of system
4. **"Identical copy"** - Explicit identity
5. **"Human"** - Human opponent

This gradient helps identify the minimum information needed for cooperation.

### Prompt Sensitivity Testing

```json
"robustness_tests": [
  {
    "id": "prompt_sensitivity",
    "variations": [
      "explicit_superrationality",
      "implicit_correlation", 
      "neutral_description",
      "competition_framing",
      "cooperation_framing"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Key Improvements from Original Design

1. **Cleaner Causal Isolation**: One-shot games eliminate reciprocity confounds
2. **Systematic Progression**: Each phase tests a specific hypothesis
3. **Opponent Type Control**: Varies information about opponent nature
4. **Simplified Metrics**: Focus on cooperation rate as primary measure
5. **Robustness Built-in**: Multiple trials, models, and phrasings

## Running the New Experiments

```bash
# Run Phase 1: One-shot baseline tests
python run_aises_experiments.py --phase phase_1

# Run specific experiment
python run_aises_experiments.py --experiment oneshot_identical_info

# Run all phases in sequence
python run_aises_experiments.py --all --save

# Analyze results
python analyze_aises_results.py results/aises_*.json
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Hypothesis Testing

1. **H1: Acausal Cooperation Exists**
   - Evidence: High cooperation in `oneshot_identical_info` 
   - Counter-evidence: Low cooperation even with identity info

2. **H2: Information Gradient**
   - Evidence: Cooperation increases with more identity information
   - Counter-evidence: Binary effect (all or nothing)

3. **H3: Robustness**
   - Evidence: Consistent across models and prompts
   - Counter-evidence: High sensitivity to wording

## Advantages of Revised Approach

1. **Scientific Rigor**: Clean separation of causal vs acausal cooperation
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity systematically
3. **Clear Hypotheses**: Each phase tests specific predictions
4. **Practical Feasibility**: Can run core experiments with minimal API calls
5. **Interpretability**: Results directly map to theoretical predictions

## Timeline and Budget

### Phase 1 (Core Tests)
- **Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Cost**: ~$2-3
- **Output**: Clear answer on acausal cooperation existence

### Full Study (All Phases)
- **Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Cost**: ~$8-10
- **Output**: Comprehensive understanding of cooperation drivers

## Conclusion

The revised experimental design directly addresses both reviewer concerns:
- **Simplified objectives** with clear primary/subsidiary structure
- **Graduated difficulty** starting from maximally unfriendly conditions
- **Systematic variations** to identify minimum requirements for cooperation

This approach provides a cleaner test of acausal cooperation while maintaining scientific rigor and practical feasibility.
