üîç KEY FINDINGS

üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
1. For testing genuine superrational cooperation: Use 'identity_only' or 'implicit_identity' configurations to avoid confounding factors from global information sharing.
2. Always run control experiments (baseline_control) alongside treatment conditions to measure the true effect of identity recognition.
3. Use random defaults for ambiguous responses to avoid systematic bias. Current 'cooperate' default inflates cooperation rates.
