## Dev Notes

### Implementation Recommendations
1. **Start with base classes first** - Implement AsyncNode, AsyncFlow, and AsyncParallelBatchNode before concrete implementations
2. **Use existing config pattern** - Leverage the Config class from Story 1.1 (src/core/config.py) for API key management
3. **Implement comprehensive error handling** - Wrap all API calls with try/except and implement exponential backoff for retries
4. **Test incrementally** - Test each base class thoroughly before moving to concrete implementations
5. **Log all API failures** - Ensure experiment_errors.log captures all retry attempts and failures with context

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- Config class successfully implemented with dataclass for type safety
- Environment variable loading pattern established for API key handling
- Project structure initialized with src/core/ directory
- Testing framework (pytest) confirmed working

### Data Models
**Agent Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#agent]
```python
# Key attributes for Agent
id: int  # Unique identifier (0-9)
power: float  # Current power level (50-150)
strategy: str  # Current round strategy text
total_score: float  # Cumulative payoff across all games
```

**StrategyRecord Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#strategyrecord]
```python
# Key attributes for StrategyRecord
strategy_id: str  # Unique identifier
agent_id: int  # Agent who created strategy
round: int  # Round number
strategy_text: str  # Concise strategy for subagent
full_reasoning: str  # Complete LLM response
model: str  # Model used (gemini-2.5-flash)
```

**GameResult Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#gameresult]
```python
# Key attributes for GameResult
game_id: str  # Unique identifier (round_game format)
round: int  # Round number (1-10)
player1_id: int  # First agent ID
player2_id: int  # Second agent ID
player1_action: str  # COOPERATE or DEFECT
player2_action: str  # COOPERATE or DEFECT
```

### API Specifications
**OpenRouter API Client** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
```python
# API configuration for OpenRouter
BASE_URL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")

# Headers for API requests
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Model specifications
MAIN_MODEL = "google/gemini-2.5-flash"  # For strategy generation
SUB_MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"       # For subagent decisions
```

### Component Specifications
**Node Base Classes** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#node-base-classes]
```python
class AsyncNode:
    """Base class for async operations"""
    async def execute(self, context: dict) -> dict:
        raise NotImplementedError

class AsyncFlow:
    """Base class for orchestrating multiple nodes"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = []

    async def run(self, context: dict) -> dict:
        for node in self.nodes:
            context = await node.execute(context)
        return context

class AsyncParallelBatchNode(AsyncNode):
    """Execute multiple async operations in parallel"""
    async def execute_batch(self, items: list) -> list:
        tasks = [self.process_item(item) for item in items]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=False)
```

**StrategyCollectionNode Pattern** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#concurrent-strategy-collection]
```python
class StrategyCollectionNode(AsyncParallelBatchNode):
    async def process_item(self, agent: Agent) -> StrategyRecord:
        """Process single agent - called in parallel"""
        prompt = self.build_prompt(agent)
        response = await self.api_client.complete(prompt)
        return self.parse_strategy(agent, response)

    async def execute(self, context: dict) -> dict:
        agents = context["agents"]
        strategies = await self.execute_batch(agents)
        context["strategies"] = strategies
        return context
```

### File Locations
Based on the simple research experiment structure:
- `src/nodes.py` - All node classes (AsyncNode, AsyncFlow, AsyncParallelBatchNode, StrategyCollectionNode, SubagentDecisionNode) [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
- `src/experiment.py` - Main ExperimentFlow and orchestration logic [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
- `src/game_logic.py` - Payoff calculations and game execution [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
- `src/api_client.py` - OpenRouter integration for API calls [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
- `test_experiment.py` - All tests for node architecture [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/simple-testing-approach.md]
- Use pytest framework with pytest-asyncio for async tests
- Focus on essential tests for node functionality
- Test scenarios to implement:
  - Async node execution with mocked API calls
  - Retry logic (simulate failures and verify 3 retry attempts)
  - Partial batch failure handling (one agent fails, others continue)
  - Context validation between nodes
  - Error propagation and logging

**Example async test pattern:**
```python
import pytest
import asyncio
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_node_retry():
    # Mock API client that fails twice then succeeds
    mock_client = Mock()
    mock_client.complete.side_effect = [Exception("API Error"), Exception("API Error"), {"content": "response"}]

    node = StrategyCollectionNode(api_client=mock_client)
    result = await node.process_item(agent)

    assert mock_client.complete.call_count == 3
    assert result is not None
```

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.11+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must support async operations using asyncio
- Error handling must include retry logic (max 3 retries) for API failures [Source: Epic 1 Technical Details]
- Must handle partial failures gracefully (continue if single agent fails) [Source: Epic 1 Technical Details]
- Rate limiting: Respect API rate limits with appropriate delays
- Logging: All errors must be logged to `experiment_errors.log`

### Context Dictionary Structure
The context dict passed between nodes must contain:
```python
context = {
    "experiment_id": str,           # Unique experiment identifier
    "round": int,                   # Current round number (1-10)
    "agents": List[Agent],          # List of all agents with current state
    "strategies": List[StrategyRecord],  # Strategies for current round
    "games": List[GameResult],      # Games played in current round
    "round_summaries": List[RoundSummary],  # Previous round summaries
    "config": Config,               # Experiment configuration
    "data_manager": DataManager,    # For saving results
}
```

## Testing
- Test file location: Add all node tests to existing `test_experiment.py` in project root
- Test framework: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- Testing patterns: Mock external API calls, test async operations, verify error handling
- Specific test cases required:
  1. AsyncNode retry logic (verify 3 attempts before failure)
  2. AsyncParallelBatchNode partial failure handling
  3. Context validation and passing between nodes
  4. API response parsing for both models
  5. Error logging to experiment_errors.log
