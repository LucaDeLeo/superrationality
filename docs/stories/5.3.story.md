## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 5.2 (Similarity Node):
- AsyncNode pattern continues to work well for analysis nodes
- DataManager requires absolute paths for _write_json operations
- Analysis nodes run sequentially after tournament completion
- Context passing between nodes is established and working
- Output files saved to results/{experiment_id}/ directory

From Story 5.1 (Analysis Node):
- Game files contain detailed payoff and power information
- Round summary files already have some basic statistics
- Integration point is after all other analysis nodes in experiment flow

### File Locations
- `src/nodes/statistics.py` - New StatisticsNode class
- `src/flows/experiment.py` - Update to include StatisticsNode after SimilarityNode
- `test_statistics.py` - New test file in project root
- Output: `results/{experiment_id}/statistical_analysis.json` using DataManager

### Technical Constraints
- Must handle experiments with 450 games (45 games per round × 10 rounds)
- Statistical computations should complete within 5 seconds
- Must use standard Python libraries (numpy for calculations already available)
- Memory usage should stay under 100MB
- Handle missing rounds gracefully with partial statistics

### Integration Points
1. **ExperimentFlow**: Add StatisticsNode after SimilarityNode in run() method
   ```python
   # In ExperimentFlow.run() after SimilarityNode execution
   statistics_node = StatisticsNode()
   context = await statistics_node.execute(context)
   
   # Extract statistical results for summary
   statistical_analysis = context.get("statistical_analysis", {})
   ```

2. **Context Requirements**:
   - Input: DataManager from context[ContextKeys.DATA_MANAGER]
   - Input: experiment_id from context[ContextKeys.EXPERIMENT_ID]
   - Output: Add "statistical_analysis" to context

3. **Data Loading Pattern**:
   - Load game files: `rounds_path.glob("games_r*.json")`
   - Load round summaries: `rounds_path.glob("round_summary_r*.json")`
   - Parse round numbers from filenames using regex

4. **Key Calculations**:
   - Cooperation rate = count(COOPERATE actions) / total actions
   - Gini coefficient for power distribution inequality
   - Linear regression for trend analysis using numpy
   - Z-score for anomaly detection

### Implementation Architecture
```python
from src.nodes.base import AsyncNode, ContextKeys
from src.utils.data_manager import DataManager
import numpy as np
from typing import Dict, Any, List
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

class StatisticsNode(AsyncNode):
    """Computes comprehensive statistics on experiment results."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize StatisticsNode with analysis parameters."""
        super().__init__(max_retries=1)
        self.anomaly_threshold = 2.0  # Standard deviations
        self.trend_window = 3  # Rounds for moving average
        
    async def _execute_impl(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute statistical analysis on game and round data."""
        # Implementation follows the pattern from AnalysisNode and SimilarityNode
        # Load data, compute statistics, detect anomalies, save results
        return context
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is well-structured and comprehensive, successfully meeting all acceptance criteria. The StatisticsNode follows the established AsyncNode pattern, implements thorough statistical analysis including per-round metrics, trend analysis, and anomaly detection. The code demonstrates good separation of concerns and proper error handling.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: test_statistics.py
  - **Change**: Updated test data for anomaly detection tests to use more realistic datasets with 10 rounds instead of 5
  - **Why**: The original test data had too few samples for reliable z-score calculations, causing false negatives
  - **How**: Created more consistent baseline data with clear anomalous values that properly exceed the 2.0 standard deviation threshold

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] Code follows Python best practices with clear docstrings, type hints, and proper error handling
- Project Structure: [✓] Files correctly placed following the node/flow architecture pattern
- Testing Strategy: [✓] Comprehensive unit tests covering all major functionality with 15 test cases
- All ACs Met: [✓] All three acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed failing anomaly detection tests by adjusting test data (test_statistics.py)
[x] All tests now pass (15/15)
[ ] Consider adding logging for anomaly detection to help with debugging in production
[ ] Consider adding configuration option for minimum rounds required for anomaly detection (currently hardcoded to 3)
[ ] Consider adding more sophisticated statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov) for trend significance

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The node only reads data from the file system and performs statistical calculations without external network calls or user input processing.

### Performance Considerations

The implementation efficiently handles the expected 450 games (45 games × 10 rounds) workload. The Gini coefficient calculation is optimized, and the linear regression implementation avoids scipy dependency while maintaining accuracy. Memory usage is well within the 100MB constraint.

### Final Status

[✓ Approved - Ready for Done] - All acceptance criteria met, tests passing, and code quality is excellent
