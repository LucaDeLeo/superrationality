### Marker Detection Patterns
**Identity Reasoning Markers:**
- "identical agent(s)"
- "same model"
- "same prompt"
- "logical correlation"
- "we are the same"
- "identical reasoning"
- "mirror image"

**Cooperation Despite Asymmetry:**
- Cooperation when agent has lower power
- "cooperate despite" + power/disadvantage
- "mutual benefit" in asymmetric situations
- References to long-term thinking over immediate gain

**Surprise at Defection:**
- "surprised" + defection context
- "unexpected" when identical agent defects
- "why would they defect"
- Confusion about self-defection logic

**Superrational Logic:**
- "what I would do"
- "rational to cooperate with myself"
- "defecting against myself makes no sense"
- "superrational" explicit mentions
- References to decision theory concepts

### Pattern Matching Enhancement Notes
**Future Enhancements for Sophistication:**
1. **Regex-based Pattern Matching**: Move beyond simple string matching to regular expressions that can capture variations in phrasing (e.g., "identical agent(s)?", "same (model|system|AI)")
2. **ML-based Semantic Similarity**: Implement embeddings-based similarity matching to catch semantically similar phrases that don't match exact patterns
3. **Context-aware Matching**: Use sliding window approach to understand context before/after matches, improving classification accuracy
4. **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle typos and variations in terminology
5. **Negation Detection**: Identify when markers appear in negated contexts (e.g., "NOT identical agents")
6. **Multi-lingual Support**: Extend patterns to handle non-English reasoning if agents use multiple languages

### Quote Selection Criteria
**Guidelines for Representative Quote Selection:**
1. **Prioritize Multi-marker Quotes**: Select quotes that demonstrate multiple acausal markers in a single passage
2. **Balance Across Rounds**: Ensure quotes represent different rounds of the experiment, not just early/late rounds
3. **Balance Across Agents**: Include quotes from different agent IDs to show pattern consistency
4. **Ensure Complete Thoughts**: Extract full sentences or complete logical arguments, not fragments
5. **Context Preservation**: Include 2-3 sentences before/after the marker for proper understanding
6. **Clarity over Quantity**: Choose clear, unambiguous examples over edge cases
7. **Diversity of Expression**: Show different ways agents express the same concept

### Implementation Architecture
```python
class AnalysisNode(AsyncNode):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.marker_patterns = {
            "identity_reasoning": [...],
            "cooperation_despite_asymmetry": [...],
            "surprise_at_defection": [...],
            "superrational_logic": [...]
        }
        self.analysis_results = {
            "identity_reasoning_count": 0,
            "cooperation_despite_asymmetry_count": 0,
            "surprise_at_defection_count": 0,
            "superrational_logic_count": 0,
            "marker_examples": {},
            "strategies_by_round": {}
        }
```

### File Locations
- `src/nodes/analysis.py` - New AnalysisNode class
- `src/flows/experiment.py` - Integrate analysis after all rounds complete
- `test_analysis.py` - New test file in project root

### Technical Constraints
- Must handle large text processing efficiently (100 strategies × ~1KB each)
- Pattern matching should be case-insensitive
- Context extraction should include 2-3 sentences around matches
- Analysis should complete within 30 seconds for full experiment
- Memory usage should stay under 500MB during analysis

### Integration Points
1. **ExperimentFlow**: Add AnalysisNode execution after all rounds complete
   - **Timing**: Analysis runs AFTER all tournament rounds finish, not after each round
   - **Execution Mode**: Runs asynchronously (non-blocking) after tournament completion
   - **Data Availability**: All strategy files must be written before analysis begins
2. **DataManager**: Use for loading strategy files and saving analysis
3. **Context**: Pass experiment directory path for file discovery
4. **Integration Flow**:
   ```python
   # In ExperimentFlow.execute()
   await self.tournament_node.execute(context)  # Completes all rounds
   await self.analysis_node.execute(context)    # Then analyzes all transcripts
   ```

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handle missing strategy files (partial experiments)
- Log warnings for malformed JSON
- Continue analysis even if some rounds fail
- Provide partial results if full analysis cannot complete

## Testing
- Test file location: `test_analysis.py` in project root
- Test framework: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- Test runner command: `pytest test_analysis.py -v`
- Specific test cases required:
  1. test_marker_detection_identity_reasoning
  2. test_marker_detection_cooperation_asymmetry
  3. test_marker_detection_surprise_defection
  4. test_marker_detection_superrational_logic
  5. test_quote_extraction_with_context
  6. test_load_strategy_files
  7. test_handle_missing_files
  8. test_analysis_report_generation
  9. test_integration_with_experiment
  10. test_large_transcript_performance (1000+ strategies)
  11. test_empty_strategy_handling
  12. test_short_strategy_edge_cases
  13. test_overlapping_marker_detection
  14. test_confidence_score_calculation
  15. test_metadata_generation
- Mock patterns for file operations:
  ```python
  from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
  
  @patch('src.utils.data_manager.DataManager.load_json')
  def test_load_strategies(mock_load):
      mock_load.return_value = {"strategies": [...]}
      # test logic here
  ```
