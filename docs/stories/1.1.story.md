# Story 1.1: Setup Experiment Parameters

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** to configure core experiment parameters (10 agents, 10 rounds, model selections),
**so that** the experiment runs with the correct configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Parameters are easily configurable and properly validated
2. Configuration supports:
   - NUM_AGENTS = 10
   - NUM_ROUNDS = 10
   - MAIN_MODEL = "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free"
   - SUB_MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create configuration management system (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create Config class in src/core/config.py with experiment parameters
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement parameter validation (ensure NUM_AGENTS and NUM_ROUNDS are positive integers)
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Add model configuration with default values for MAIN_MODEL and SUB_MODEL
- [x] Task 2: Set up environment variable handling (AC: 1)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create .env.example file with OPENROUTER_API_KEY placeholder
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Implement environment variable loading in Config class
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Add validation to ensure API key is present
- [x] Task 3: Create experiment configuration structure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Define configuration file structure in configs/ directory
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Create baseline.yaml with default experiment parameters
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Implement YAML configuration loader in Config class
- [x] Task 4: Write unit tests for configuration (AC: 1)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Test Config class initialization with valid parameters
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Test parameter validation with invalid values
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Test environment variable loading and API key validation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story of the project.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story. Configuration will use Python dataclasses or simple dictionaries.
[Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

### API Specifications
**OpenRouter API Configuration** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-key-configuration]
- API key must be stored in environment variable `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Headers configuration:
  ```python
  {
      "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications
No UI components in this story - backend configuration only.
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table - No frontend needed]

### File Locations
Based on the project structure, new files should be created at:
- `src/core/config.py` - Main Config class [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#function-organization]
- `.env.example` - API key template [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
- `configs/baseline.yaml` - Default configuration [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
- Test file: `test_config.py` or within `test_experiment.py` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/simple-testing-approach.md#basic-tests]
- Use pytest framework (version 7.x) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Focus on essential tests for research experiment
- Test configuration validation and environment variable loading
- No specific test file structure mentioned in architecture docs

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.11+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Must support async operations for future integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Use built-in Python dict/dataclass for state management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

## Testing
- Test file location: Create `test_config.py` in project root or add tests to existing `test_experiment.py`
- Test framework: pytest 7.x
- Testing patterns: Focus on unit tests for configuration validation
- Specific requirements: Test all parameter validation, environment variable handling, and configuration loading

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid foundational work with proper use of Python dataclasses, comprehensive validation, and good separation of concerns. The Config class is well-structured with clear responsibilities. The test suite is comprehensive, covering all major scenarios including edge cases. The code follows Python best practices and maintains good readability.

### Refactoring Performed

None required. The implementation is clean, well-organized, and follows established patterns. The use of dataclasses with post-initialization validation is appropriate for this use case.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Python conventions and best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed correctly according to architecture guidance
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with edge case coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

All implementation aspects are satisfactory. No improvements needed.

### Security Review

- API key handling is secure - uses environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Proper validation prevents injection through config values

### Performance Considerations

- Lightweight configuration loading with minimal overhead
- YAML parsing only occurs when explicitly requested
- No performance concerns for this implementation

### Technical Deep Dive

**Strengths:**
1. **Dataclass Usage**: Excellent choice using `@dataclass` for type safety and automatic initialization
2. **Validation Pattern**: Post-init validation ensures data integrity immediately upon instantiation
3. **Error Messages**: Clear, specific error messages that guide users to fix issues
4. **Test Coverage**: All 8 tests pass coverage for initialization, validation, environment loading, and YAML parsing
5. **API Headers Method**: Clean abstraction for OpenRouter API integration

**Code Architecture:**
- Single responsibility principle well applied
- Config class handles configuration, validation, and environment loading cohesively
- Clean separation between configuration loading methods (constructor vs from_yaml)

**Testing Quality:**
- Proper test isolation with environment variable management
- Good use of pytest fixtures and assertions
- Edge cases covered (negative numbers, zero values, missing env vars)
- Temporary file handling in YAML tests is clean

### Missing Dependencies Note

The project lacks a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml file. While pytest is specified in the tech stack (version 7.x), there's no dependency management file. This should be addressed in a future story to ensure consistent development environments.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

Excellent implementation meeting all requirements with clean, maintainable code.
