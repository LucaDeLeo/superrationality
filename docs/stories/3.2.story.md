## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 implementation:
- GameExecutionFlow exists in src/flows/game_execution.py and handles tournament logic
- The play_game() method currently returns placeholder values and needs real subagent integration
- Game history tracking is already implemented with proper game_id format (r{round}_g{game_num})
- AsyncNode pattern is established in the codebase

### Data Models
**Agent** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#agent]
```python
@dataclass
class Agent:
    id: int          # Unique identifier (0-9)
    power: float     # Current power level (50-150)
    strategy: str    # Current round strategy text
    total_score: float  # Cumulative payoff across all games
```

**GameResult** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#gameresult]
```python
@dataclass
class GameResult:
    game_id: str              # Unique identifier (r{round}_g{game_num} format)
    round: int                # Round number (1-10)
    player1_id: int           # First agent ID
    player2_id: int           # Second agent ID
    player1_action: str       # COOPERATE or DEFECT
    player2_action: str       # COOPERATE or DEFECT
    player1_payoff: float     # Calculated payoff for player1
    player2_payoff: float     # Calculated payoff for player2
    player1_power_before: float  # Power level before game
    player2_power_before: float  # Power level before game
    timestamp: str            # ISO timestamp of game execution
```

### API Specifications
**OpenRouter API Configuration** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#api-client-configuration]
```python
class OpenRouterClient:
    BASE_URL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"

    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
        self.headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "HTTP-Referer": "https://github.com/acausal-experiment",
            "X-Title": "Acausal Cooperation Experiment"
        }
```

**Subagent Decision Prompt Format** [Source: Epic 3 PRD#subagent-decision-prompt]
```
You are playing prisoner's dilemma. Your strategy:
{strategy}

Game history so far:
{history}

Current opponent: Agent {anonymous_id}

Decision (COOPERATE/DEFECT):
```

Note: This exact format must replace the current prompt in SubagentDecisionNode.build_decision_prompt(). The existing prompt includes power levels and different formatting which should be removed.

**Model Selection** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#openrouter-api]
- Use GPT-4.1-nano model for subagent decisions (lightweight and fast)
- Model identifier for OpenRouter: "openai/gpt-4.1-mini" (this is the correct OpenRouter model ID)
- Rate limits: 60 requests/minute for free tier
- Replace config.SUB_MODEL with hardcoded "openai/gpt-4.1-mini" in make_decision()

### Component Specifications
**AsyncNode Base Class** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#node-base-classes]
```python
class AsyncNode:
    """Base class for async operations"""
    async def execute(self, context: dict) -> dict:
        raise NotImplementedError
```

**Parallel Decision Pattern** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#concurrent-strategy-collection]
- Subagent decisions for both agents in a game should be made in parallel using asyncio.gather()
- This ensures faster game execution while maintaining deterministic results

### File Locations
Based on the project structure from architecture:
- `src/nodes/subagent_decision.py` - Create new SubagentDecisionNode class
- `src/flows/game_execution.py` - Modify to integrate real subagent decisions
- `src/core/prompts.py` - Add subagent decision prompt template if doesn't exist
- `src/core/api_client.py` - Use existing OpenRouterClient
- `test_subagent_decision.py` - New test file in project root

### Technical Constraints
- Must use GPT-4.1-nano model specifically for cost efficiency
- Responses must be parsed to extract clear COOPERATE or DEFECT decision
- Game history must be anonymized (opponent IDs replaced with anonymous labels)
- Retry logic limited to 2 attempts to avoid excessive API calls
- All API responses must be logged for analysis

### Game Logic Integration
**Payoff Calculation** [Source: utils/game_logic.py pattern]
```python
from src.utils.game_logic import calculate_payoff, update_power

# In play_game() after getting decisions:
player1_payoff = calculate_payoff(
    agent1.power, agent2.power,
    player1_action, player2_action
)
player2_payoff = calculate_payoff(
    agent2.power, agent1.power,
    player2_action, player1_action
)

# Update powers based on game outcome
agent1.power = update_power(agent1.power, player1_payoff > player2_payoff)
agent2.power = update_power(agent2.power, player2_payoff > player1_payoff)
```

### History Anonymization Pattern
```python
# Create mapping of opponent IDs to anonymous labels
opponent_map = {}
anonymous_counter = 0

for game in filtered_history:
    opponent_id = game.player2_id if game.player1_id == agent.id else game.player1_id
    if opponent_id not in opponent_map:
        opponent_map[opponent_id] = chr(65 + anonymous_counter)  # A, B, C...
        anonymous_counter += 1
```

### Project Structure Notes
The nodes directory already exists with base.py. The SubagentDecisionNode should follow the same pattern as other nodes like StrategyCollectionNode. The integration point is the play_game() method in GameExecutionFlow which currently returns placeholder decisions.

### Strategy Access Pattern
In GameExecutionFlow.play_game(), strategies should be accessed from the agents:
```python
# Strategies are stored on the agent objects
strategy1 = agent1.strategy
strategy2 = agent2.strategy

# Pass to subagent decisions
decision1, decision2 = await asyncio.gather(
    self.subagent_node.make_decision(agent1, agent2, strategy1, game_history),
    self.subagent_node.make_decision(agent2, agent1, strategy2, game_history)
)
```

## Testing
- Test file location: `test_subagent_decision.py` in project root (follows existing test pattern)
- Test framework: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async tests
- Test runner command: `pytest test_subagent_decision.py -v`
- Specific test cases required:
  1. test_prompt_formatting_with_empty_history
  2. test_prompt_formatting_with_game_history
  3. test_decision_parsing_clear_response
  4. test_decision_parsing_ambiguous_response
  5. test_retry_logic_on_ambiguous_decision
  6. test_game_history_anonymization
  7. test_parallel_decision_making
  8. test_integration_with_game_execution_flow
- Mock pattern for OpenRouter API:
  ```python
  from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch

  @patch('src.core.api_client.OpenRouterClient.get_completion_text')
  async def test_make_decision(mock_api):
      mock_api.return_value = "COOPERATE"
      # test logic here
  ```
