### Implementation Architecture
```python
class ReportGeneratorNode(AsyncNode):
    """Generates unified analysis reports from all analysis nodes."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
        super().__init__()
        self.config = config or {}
        self.report_formats = ["json", "markdown", "latex"]
        
        # Configurable acausal score weights
        self.acausal_weights = self.config.get("acausal_weights", {
            "identity_reasoning": 0.3,
            "cooperation_rate": 0.25,
            "strategy_convergence": 0.25,
            "cooperation_trend": 0.2
        })
        
        # Configurable report sections
        self.enabled_sections = self.config.get("enabled_sections", {
            "executive_summary": True,
            "detailed_findings": True,
            "visualizations": True,
            "latex_sections": True,
            "correlation_analysis": True
        })
        
    async def _execute_impl(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generate comprehensive reports from analysis results."""
        # Extract results from context
        transcript_analysis = context.get("transcript_analysis", {})
        similarity_analysis = context.get("similarity_analysis", {})
        statistical_analysis = context.get("statistical_analysis", {})
        
        # Synthesize findings
        synthesis = self._synthesize_findings(
            transcript_analysis,
            similarity_analysis, 
            statistical_analysis
        )
        
        # Generate reports
        reports = {
            "synthesis": synthesis,
            "executive_summary": self._generate_executive_summary(synthesis),
            "visualizations": self._prepare_visualization_data(synthesis),
            "latex_sections": self._generate_latex_sections(synthesis),
            "markdown_report": self._generate_markdown_report(synthesis)
        }
        
        # Save reports
        self._save_reports(reports, context)
        
        context["unified_report"] = reports
        return context
```

### Synthesis Logic
**Cross-Analysis Correlations:**
1. **Identity → Cooperation**: Correlate identity reasoning frequency with cooperation rates
2. **Similarity → Convergence**: Link strategy similarity to cooperation convergence
3. **Power → Strategy**: Analyze how power levels influence strategy choices
4. **Anomalies → Patterns**: Connect anomalous rounds to strategy shifts

**Unified Acausal Score Calculation:**
```python
def calculate_acausal_score(self, transcript, similarity, statistics):
    """Calculate unified score from 0-1 indicating acausal cooperation strength."""
    # Use configurable weights from initialization
    weights = self.acausal_weights
    
    scores = {
        "identity_reasoning": transcript.get("identity_reasoning_frequency", 0),
        "cooperation_rate": statistics.get("overall_cooperation_rate", 0),
        "strategy_convergence": similarity.get("strategy_convergence", 0),
        "cooperation_trend": self._score_trend(statistics.get("cooperation_trend", {}))
    }
    
    return sum(weights[k] * scores[k] for k in weights)
```

### File Locations
- `src/nodes/report_generator.py` - New ReportGeneratorNode class
- `src/flows/experiment.py` - Update to include ReportGeneratorNode
- `test_report_generator.py` - New test file in project root
- Outputs:
  - `results/{experiment_id}/unified_report.json`
  - `results/{experiment_id}/experiment_report.md`
  - `results/{experiment_id}/paper_sections.tex`
  - `results/{experiment_id}/visualization_data.json`

### Technical Constraints
- Must handle missing analysis components gracefully
- LaTeX generation must properly escape special characters
- Markdown formatting should be GitHub-compatible
- Visualization data structures compatible with matplotlib 3.x+, plotly 5.x+, and seaborn 0.12+
- Report generation should complete within 10 seconds

### Integration Points
1. **ExperimentFlow**: Add ReportGeneratorNode as final analysis step
   ```python
   # After all analysis nodes
   report_config = {
       "acausal_weights": {
           "identity_reasoning": 0.3,
           "cooperation_rate": 0.25,
           "strategy_convergence": 0.25,
           "cooperation_trend": 0.2
       },
       "enabled_sections": {
           "executive_summary": True,
           "detailed_findings": True,
           "visualizations": True,
           "latex_sections": True,
           "correlation_analysis": True
       }
   }
   report_generator = ReportGeneratorNode(config=report_config)
   context = await report_generator.execute(context)
   
   # Print report locations
   print(f"\nReports generated:")
   print(f"- Markdown: {results_path}/experiment_report.md")
   print(f"- LaTeX: {results_path}/paper_sections.tex")
   print(f"- Visualizations: {results_path}/visualization_data.json")
   ```

2. **Context Requirements**:
   - Input: All analysis results from context
   - Input: DataManager and experiment_id
   - Output: Unified report data and file locations

### Error Handling

### Minor Observations (No Action Required)
1. LaTeX generation creates individual sections rather than full document with preamble - this is appropriate for integration into larger papers
2. Weight normalization warning is properly logged when weights don't sum to 1.0
3. All edge cases (no cooperation, perfect cooperation) handled appropriately

### Recommendations
None - the implementation is complete and production-ready.

### Conclusion
Story 5.4 has been implemented with exceptional quality. The ReportGeneratorNode successfully synthesizes complex analysis results into multiple useful formats, providing researchers with comprehensive insights into acausal cooperation experiments. The code is well-tested, properly documented, and follows all project conventions.
