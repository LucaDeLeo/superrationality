## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Epic 6 completed the multi-model experiments infrastructure with comprehensive data organization:
- Scenario-based result organization in `results/{experiment_id}/scenarios/{scenario_name}/`
- Existing visualization utilities (coalition_visualizer.py, diversity_visualizer.py)
- JSON-based data storage format that the dashboard will need to read
- DataManager utility class handles all file I/O operations
[Source: docs/stories/6.4.story.md#Dev-Agent-Record]

### Data Models
The dashboard will need to work with existing Python dataclasses converted to TypeScript:
```python
@dataclass
class ExperimentResult:
    experiment_id: str
    start_time: str
    end_time: str
    total_rounds: int
    total_games: int
    total_api_calls: int
    total_cost: float
    round_summaries: List[RoundSummary]
    acausal_indicators: Dict[str, float]
```
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#ExperimentResult]

Additional models: Agent, GameResult, StrategyRecord, RoundSummary
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications
New RESTful API endpoints to implement:
- GET /api/v1/experiments - List all experiments with pagination
- GET /api/v1/experiments/{id} - Get experiment details
- GET /api/v1/experiments/{id}/rounds/{round} - Get specific round data
- POST /api/v1/auth/login - Authenticate user
- POST /api/v1/auth/logout - End session
- WS /ws - WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
[Source: Epic 7 PRD requirements]

### File Locations
Based on project structure patterns:
- `dashboard/` - NEW directory for React frontend application
- `src/api/` - NEW directory for API server code
- `src/api/server.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- `src/api/routers/` - API route handlers
- `src/api/data_loader.py` - Data loading utilities
- `test_api.py` - API tests in project root
[Source: Project structure analysis]

### Frontend Technology Stack
From Epic 7 PRD:
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- React Router for navigation
- D3.js or Plotly for visualizations (future stories)
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-prd.md#Technical-Requirements]

### Backend Technology Stack
Extending existing Python codebase:
- FastAPI for modern async API server
- Pydantic for request/response validation
- python-jose for JWT token handling
- websockets for real-time communication
- Existing DataManager for file access
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md + Epic 7 requirements]

### Technical Constraints
- Dashboard must be read-only (no modification of experiment data)
- Must handle experiments with 100+ rounds efficiently
- API responses must be paginated for large datasets
- Authentication is basic (no complex user management needed)
- Must work with existing JSON file storage format
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-prd.md#Constraints]

### Integration Points
1. **DataManager**: Reuse existing `src/utils/data_manager.py` for file access
2. **Models**: Import existing dataclasses from `src/core/models.py`
3. **File Format**: Read JSON files from `results/` directory structure
4. **Visualization Utils**: Can leverage existing visualizer classes for data preparation

### Performance Considerations
- Implement server-side caching for repeated data requests
- Use pagination with default 20 items per page
- Lazy load experiment details only when requested
- WebSocket updates should be throttled to prevent overload
- Frontend should implement virtual scrolling for large lists
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-prd.md#Success-Metrics]

## Testing
- Test file locations:
  - `dashboard/src/__tests__/` - Frontend unit tests
  - `dashboard/cypress/` or `dashboard/playwright/` - E2E tests
  - `test_api.py` - Backend API tests in project root
- Frontend testing: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for components
- Backend testing: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async endpoints
- E2E testing: Playwright for full user flow testing
- Test requirements:
  - All API endpoints must have request/response validation tests
  - React components must have rendering and interaction tests
  - WebSocket connections must be tested for failures and reconnection
  - Authentication flow must be fully tested
  - Error states and edge cases must have coverage

## QA Results

### Review Summary
**Status**: MAJOR ISSUES FOUND - Story implementation is INCOMPLETE
**Review Date**: 2025-08-02
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)

### Critical Issues

1. **Frontend Application Not Integrated** 🔴
   - The main App.tsx still contains the default Vite template code
   - Dashboard components exist but are not wired into the application
   - No routing setup in the main application despite having React Router components
   - Missing authentication flow integration in the frontend

2. **Security Vulnerabilities** 🔴
   - Hardcoded JWT secret key in production code: `"your-secret-key-change-in-production"`
   - Basic auth with hardcoded admin credentials
   - No environment variable management for sensitive data
   - datetime.utcnow() is deprecated - should use datetime.now(timezone.utc)

3. **Missing Core Infrastructure** 🟡
   - No actual authentication UI components (login form, logout button)
   - WebSocket context exists but isn't properly integrated with the app
   - Missing error boundary wrapper in the main application
   - No theme provider integration in App.tsx

### Code Quality Issues

1. **Backend Issues**:
   - Missing proper error handling in data_loader.py (bare except clauses)
   - No validation for file paths - potential directory traversal vulnerability
   - Cache implementation is not thread-safe
   - Missing logging configuration

2. **Frontend Issues**:
   - TypeScript strict mode violations in multiple files
   - Missing proper type definitions for API responses
   - No API client implementation found (referenced but not implemented)
   - Import aliases configured but inconsistently used

3. **Testing Gaps**:
   - No integration tests between frontend and backend
   - Missing E2E test implementation (referenced but not found)
   - WebSocket tests use mocks instead of actual connections
   - No tests for authentication flow

### Architecture Concerns

1. **Data Flow**:
   - Frontend references non-existent API client (`@services/api`)
   - No clear state management strategy (Redux/Zustand/Context)
   - Missing data fetching library setup (React Query mentioned in dev notes)

2. **Build & Development**:
   - No development server configuration for concurrent frontend/backend
   - Missing proxy configuration for API calls during development
   - No production build configuration

### Positive Aspects

1. **Good Structure**: Component organization follows best practices
2. **TypeScript Setup**: Strict configuration with proper path aliases
3. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS properly configured with mobile-first approach
4. **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Well-designed connection manager with reconnection logic
5. **Testing Framework**: Proper test setup with Vitest and React Testing Library

### Required Fixes

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Wire up the Dashboard in App.tsx with proper routing
   - Implement the missing API client service
   - Add environment variable handling for secrets
   - Create login/authentication UI components

2. **Security Fixes**:
   - Move all secrets to environment variables
   - Add proper input validation in API endpoints
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Add rate limiting for API endpoints

3. **Infrastructure Completion**:
   - Set up concurrent dev server (frontend + backend)
   - Implement missing E2E tests
   - Add proper logging configuration
   - Create development setup documentation

### Recommendation
This story cannot be considered complete. While individual components are well-written, the application is not functional as delivered. The dashboard cannot be accessed, authentication is not implemented in the UI, and critical security issues exist.

**Action Required**: Return to development for completion of integration tasks and security fixes.

### RE-REVIEW Summary
**Status**: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS - Story implementation STILL INCOMPLETE
**Re-Review Date**: 2025-08-02
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)

### Issues Resolved ✅

1. **Frontend Integration** - FIXED
   - App.tsx now properly integrates all components with routing
   - Authentication flow is properly wired with login/logout
   - Error boundary and theme provider are correctly integrated
   - WebSocket context is properly wrapped around protected routes

2. **Security Improvements** - PARTIALLY FIXED
   - JWT_SECRET_KEY now required as environment variable (server won't start without it)
   - .env.example updated with proper configuration
   - Test configuration updated to handle JWT_SECRET_KEY requirement
   - Still using hardcoded admin/admin credentials (acceptable for MVP)

3. **Missing Components** - FIXED
   - Login page component created with proper authentication UI
   - Logout functionality added to Header component
   - Dashboard README created with comprehensive setup instructions

### Remaining Critical Issues 🔴

1. **Deprecated datetime.utcnow()** - NOT FIXED
   - Still using deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` in 5 locations
   - Should use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead
   - Found in: server.py (3 instances), websocket_manager.py (2 instances)

2. **Security Concern** - NOT ADDRESSED
   - Dashboard README shows password as `admin123` but code expects `admin`
   - This inconsistency will confuse users trying to log in

3. **Missing API Client Implementation** - CRITICAL
   - The frontend references `@services/api` but this file doesn't exist
   - Dashboard cannot function without the API client service
   - All data fetching will fail

4. **Backend Path Validation** - SECURITY RISK
   - No validation in data_loader.py for directory traversal attacks
   - Could potentially access files outside results directory

### Code Quality Issues Still Present

1. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - E2E tests referenced but not implemented
   - No actual Playwright tests found despite configuration

2. **Development Experience**:
   - No concurrent dev server setup
   - Developers must manually start both frontend and backend

3. **Type Safety**:
   - API response types not properly defined
   - Could lead to runtime errors

### Positive Improvements

1. **Better Documentation**: Dashboard README provides clear setup instructions
2. **Environment Configuration**: Proper .env.example with all required variables
3. **Component Quality**: Individual components are well-structured
4. **Authentication Flow**: Properly implemented with JWT tokens

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **CRITICAL**: Create the missing `dashboard/src/services/api.ts` file
2. **HIGH**: Fix datetime.utcnow() deprecation warnings
3. **HIGH**: Fix password inconsistency in documentation
4. **MEDIUM**: Add path validation in data_loader.py
5. **MEDIUM**: Implement actual E2E tests

### Revised Recommendation

While significant progress has been made, the story still cannot be considered complete. The missing API client is a show-stopper - the application cannot function without it. The security issues with datetime and path validation also need addressing before this can go to production.

**Action Required**: 
1. Implement the missing API client service (dashboard/src/services/api.ts)
2. Fix the remaining security issues
3. Update documentation for password consistency

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours to complete remaining tasks

## Next Developer Context

This is the first story in Epic 7, establishing the foundation for the visualization dashboard. Key points:

1. **Two-part implementation**: Frontend (React) and Backend (FastAPI API)
2. **Leverage existing code**: Reuse DataManager and model definitions
3. **Start simple**: Basic CRUD operations before complex visualizations
4. **Authentication**: Simple JWT-based auth, not enterprise-grade
5. **Real-time ready**: WebSocket infrastructure for future live monitoring

The dashboard will be a separate application that reads from the existing experiment results. It should not modify any experiment data or interfere with running experiments.

Critical first steps:
1. Set up the development environment with both frontend and backend
2. Ensure API can read existing experiment JSON files
3. Create basic UI that can list and browse experiments
4. Establish the authentication pattern for protected endpoints

Future stories will add specific visualizations (tournaments, transcripts, heatmaps, etc.).
