# Story 2.3: Strategy Storage

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 implementation:
- StrategyCollectionNode successfully collects strategies in parallel
- parse_strategy() method extracts strategy_text and stores full response as full_reasoning
- Strategies are returned as List[StrategyRecord] and added to context
- DataManager already exists in src/utils/data_manager.py with save_strategies() method
- Atomic file writing is implemented using tempfile and shutil.move()

### Data Models
**StrategyRecord** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#strategyrecord]
```python
@dataclass
class StrategyRecord:
    """Stores the full strategy reasoning and decision from main agents"""
    strategy_id: str      # Unique identifier
    agent_id: int         # Agent who created strategy
    round: int           # Round number
    strategy_text: str   # Concise strategy for subagent
    full_reasoning: str  # Complete LLM response with reasoning
    prompt_tokens: int   # Tokens used in prompt
    completion_tokens: int # Tokens in response
    model: str          # Model used (gemini-2.5-flash)
    timestamp: str      # ISO timestamp
```

**Output Format from Epic 2** [Source: Epic 2 PRD - Technical Details]
```json
{
  "round": 1,
  "agent_id": 0,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free",
  "strategy": "Extracted concise strategy",
  "full_reasoning": "Complete response transcript",
  "prompt_tokens": 500,
  "completion_tokens": 300
}
```

Note: The Epic 2 format uses "strategy" while StrategyRecord uses "strategy_text". The DataManager.save_strategies() will need to handle this field name mapping.

### Component Specifications
**DataManager.save_strategies() Implementation** [Source: Current implementation in data_manager.py]
The method already exists and implements:
- Atomic writes using tempfile
- Creates path: `experiment_path/rounds/strategies_r{N}.json`
- Saves data structure with round, timestamp, and strategies list
- Uses asdict() to convert StrategyRecord objects to dictionaries

**Token Count Tracking**
The OpenRouterClient may need to return token counts from API responses. Currently, StrategyRecord in models.py needs to be checked for prompt_tokens and completion_tokens fields.

### File Locations
Based on the nested folder structure from architecture:
- `src/core/models.py` - Check/update StrategyRecord dataclass (modify)
- `src/utils/data_manager.py` - DataManager with save_strategies() method (already exists)
- `src/nodes/strategy_collection.py` - StrategyCollectionNode with parse_strategy() (modify)
- `src/flows/experiment.py` - ExperimentFlow where strategies are saved (modify)
- `src/core/api_client.py` - OpenRouterClient for token count extraction (check/modify)
- `test_strategy_storage.py` - New test file in project root (create)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use pytest framework (version 7.x)
- Test file location: `test_strategy_storage.py` in project root
- Follow Python testing best practices
- Mock file I/O operations to avoid creating actual files during tests
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain exact JSON format from Epic 2 specification
- File names must follow pattern: `strategies_r{N}.json` where N is round number
- All timestamps must be ISO format
- Full reasoning transcript must be preserved without any truncation
- Storage must be atomic to prevent corruption on failure

### Project Structure Notes
The DataManager is already in the correct location (src/utils/) following the nested structure. The save_strategies() method exists but may need updates to ensure the output format exactly matches the Epic 2 specification, particularly the field name mapping from "strategy_text" to "strategy".

## Testing
- Test file location: `test_strategy_storage.py` in project root
- Test framework: pytest
- Specific test cases required:
  1. test_save_strategies_creates_correct_file_path
  2. test_json_structure_matches_epic_specification
  3. test_full_reasoning_preserved_without_truncation
  4. test_metadata_fields_populated_correctly
  5. test_atomic_write_prevents_corruption
  6. test_error_handling_for_write_failures

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully achieves all acceptance criteria with well-structured, maintainable code. The developer demonstrated strong attention to detail by:
- Implementing token tracking through a new `get_completion_with_usage()` method that properly extracts usage data from API responses
- Correctly handling field name mapping between internal models and Epic 2 output format
- Following proper error handling patterns with comprehensive logging
- Creating atomic file writes to prevent data corruption
- Writing thorough unit tests covering all edge cases

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was needed. The implementation follows good software engineering practices:
- Proper separation of concerns between API client, strategy collection, and data persistence
- Clean abstraction with the new `get_completion_with_usage()` method
- Appropriate use of Python's typing and dataclasses
- Consistent error handling patterns across all modified components

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clean, well-documented Python code following PEP 8
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly placed according to nested folder structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive pytest-based unit tests with mocking
- All ACs Met: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

All implementation requirements have been completed successfully:
- [x] Token tracking implemented in OpenRouterClient
- [x] Field name mapping handled in DataManager (strategy_text → strategy)
- [x] Atomic file writes prevent corruption
- [x] Comprehensive error handling with logging
- [x] Unit tests cover all specified scenarios
- [x] Metadata fields (timestamp, model, round) properly populated

### Security Review

No security concerns identified:
- API keys are properly handled through configuration
- No sensitive data is logged
- File writes use atomic operations to prevent race conditions
- Proper input validation in all data models

### Performance Considerations

Performance is appropriate for the use case:
- Atomic file writes add minimal overhead while ensuring data integrity
- JSON serialization is efficient for the expected data volumes
- Proper async/await usage maintains concurrency in API calls
- No performance bottlenecks identified

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation excellently fulfills all requirements with robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and proper adherence to the Epic 2 specification. The code is production-ready and maintainable.
