## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 7.1 established the dashboard infrastructure with:
- React frontend at `dashboard/` with TypeScript and Vite
- FastAPI backend with endpoints for experiments and rounds
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Authentication system with JWT tokens
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
[Source: docs/stories/7.1.story.md#Dev-Agent-Record]

### Data Models
Tournament data structure from round summaries:
```json
{
  "round": 1,
  "cooperation_rate": 0.75,
  "average_score": 24.5,
  "score_variance": 2.1,
  "power_distribution": {
    "mean": 100.0,
    "std": 15.5,
    "min": 75.0,
    "max": 125.0
  },
  "score_distribution": {
    "min": 18.0,
    "max": 30.0,
    "avg": 24.5
  },
  "anonymized_games": [...]
}
```
[Source: Examination of results/exp_*/rounds/summary_r*.json]

### API Endpoints
Existing endpoints from Story 7.1:
- GET /api/v1/experiments - List experiments
- GET /api/v1/experiments/{id} - Get experiment details
- GET /api/v1/experiments/{id}/rounds/{round} - Get round data
[Source: docs/stories/7.1.story.md#API-Specifications]

### Visualization Libraries
- D3.js for complex, interactive visualizations
- React wrapper pattern for D3 integration
- Canvas/SVG rendering for export functionality
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-prd.md#Technical-Requirements]

### File Locations
New visualization components:
- `dashboard/src/components/visualizations/` - Chart components
- `dashboard/src/components/visualizations/CooperationChart.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/components/visualizations/MatchupHeatMap.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/components/visualizations/ScoreProgressionChart.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/components/visualizations/PowerDistributionChart.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/components/visualizations/TournamentBracket.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/components/visualizations/VisualizationFilters.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/utils/chartHelpers.ts` - Shared chart utilities
- `dashboard/src/utils/dataTransformers.ts` - Data transformation functions

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance**: Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
2. **Data Volume**: Implement virtualization for large datasets (100+ agents)
3. **Interactivity**: Debounce filter changes to prevent excessive re-renders
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure charts have proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Export Quality**: Use higher resolution (2x) for PNG exports
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-prd.md#Non-Functional-Requirements]

### Integration Points
1. **Data Loading**: Use existing DataLoader from backend API
2. **State Management**: Leverage React Query for caching chart data
3. **Filters**: Share filter state using React Context
4. **WebSocket**: Update charts in real-time for running experiments
5. **Authentication**: Charts only accessible to authenticated users

## Testing
- Test file locations:
  - `dashboard/src/components/visualizations/__tests__/` - Component tests
  - `dashboard/src/utils/__tests__/` - Utility function tests
- Testing requirements:
  - Unit tests for all data transformation functions
  - Component tests for chart rendering with mock data
  - Integration tests for filter interactions
  - Visual regression tests for chart appearance
  - Performance tests for large dataset rendering
  - Export functionality tests with file validation
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Vitest for unit tests
- Mock D3.js for faster test execution where appropriate

## QA Results

## Next Developer Context

This story builds upon the dashboard infrastructure from Story 7.1 to add the first set of interactive visualizations. Key points:

1. **Visualization First**: Focus on creating reusable, interactive charts before complex features
2. **D3.js Integration**: Use React wrapper pattern to integrate D3 with React lifecycle
3. **Performance Matters**: These visualizations may handle 100+ agents and thousands of games
4. **Export Quality**: Researchers will use exported charts in papers/presentations
5. **Real-time Ready**: Charts should update via WebSocket when new round data arrives

The visualizations should help researchers:
- Identify cooperation patterns and strategy evolution
- Spot outliers and interesting agent behaviors
- Compare tournament runs and experimental conditions
- Generate publication-quality figures

Critical implementation notes:
1. Start with static visualizations, then add interactivity
2. Ensure all charts handle empty/partial data gracefully
3. Use consistent color schemes across all visualizations
4. Implement proper loading and error states
5. Test with actual experiment data files from results/

Future stories will add transcript analysis views, similarity heatmaps, and decision flow diagrams.

## Implementation Summary for Next Developer

### Completed (Tasks 1-5):
1. **Base Infrastructure**: Created reusable ChartWrapper component with responsive behavior, loading states, and error handling. Added chart theme configuration for consistent styling across all visualizations.

2. **Data Transformers**: Implemented comprehensive data transformation utilities in `dataTransformers.ts` to convert raw round summaries into chart-ready formats. These handle agent cooperation rates, matchup matrices, score progression, and power distribution calculations.

3. **Core Visualizations**:
   - **CooperationChart**: Multi-line chart showing cooperation rates over rounds with per-agent breakdown. Includes interactive legend and tooltips.
   - **MatchupHeatMap**: Heat map matrix showing agent vs agent game outcomes with win/loss/draw statistics. Supports multiple color scales (win rate, cooperation rate, score difference).
   - **ScoreProgressionChart**: Shows cumulative score progression with support for line, area, and stacked chart types. Includes animation and range selector.
   - **PowerDistributionChart**: Statistical visualization supporting box plots, violin plots, and histograms. Features time slider for viewing distribution evolution.

4. **Chart Helpers**: Created utility functions for common chart operations like formatting, grid lines, legends, and export functionality.

5. **Testing**: Added comprehensive test coverage for all components, though some tests are failing due to pre-existing WebSocket mocking issues from Story 7.1.

### Remaining Tasks (6-9):
- **Task 6**: Tournament bracket visualization - needs bracket generation logic and interactive collapsible UI
- **Task 7**: Visualization filters - implement filter controls and connect to charts via React Context
- **Task 8**: Export functionality - implement PNG/SVG export using the chartHelpers utilities
- **Task 9**: Responsive design - ensure all charts work well on tablet devices

### Technical Notes:
- D3.js v7.9.0 is installed and configured
- All components use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Charts follow the established theme from `chartTheme.ts`
- Data flow: API → Round Summaries → Data Transformers → Chart Components
- Components are designed to handle real-time updates via props

### Integration Steps:
1. Import visualization components where needed in the dashboard
2. Connect to API data using the existing services
3. Implement the visualization filters (Task 7) to allow data filtering
4. Add export buttons to each chart using the export utilities
5. Test on actual experiment data from the results/ directory

### Known Issues:
- WebSocket tests are failing (inherited from Story 7.1)
- Some chart tests need ResizeObserver mock (fixed in test setup)
- Export functionality needs to be connected to UI buttons
