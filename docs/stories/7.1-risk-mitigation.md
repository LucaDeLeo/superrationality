# Story 7.1 Risk Mitigation Plan

## Risk Summary

This document outlines identified risks for Story 7.1 and provides mitigation strategies to ensure successful delivery of the dashboard infrastructure.

## High Priority Risks

### 1. Story Size and Scope (Probability: High, Impact: High)

**Risk**: 42 subtasks may be too large to complete in a single sprint, leading to partial implementation.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Story Splitting Option**:
   - Split into 7.1a (Core Infrastructure) and 7.1b (Advanced Features)
   - 7.1a: Tasks 1-3 (React setup, API server, basic data loading)
   - 7.1b: Tasks 4-7 (Layout, WebSocket, error handling, dashboard)

2. **Phased Delivery**:
   - Implement MVP first: Basic React app + API with experiment list
   - Defer WebSocket and advanced error handling to second phase
   - Focus on "walking skeleton" that proves end-to-end integration

3. **Parallel Development**:
   - Assign frontend developer to Tasks 1, 4, 7
   - Assign backend developer to Tasks 2, 3, 5
   - Share Task 6 (error handling) between both

**Success Metrics**: 
- Daily standup progress on subtask completion
- Mid-sprint review to assess trajectory
- Clear definition of MVP vs. nice-to-have features

### 2. Authentication Security (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)

**Risk**: JWT implementation could have security vulnerabilities if not properly implemented.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Security Checklist**:
   ```python
   # Required security measures
   - Use strong secret key (min 256 bits)
   - Set appropriate token expiration (e.g., 24 hours)
   - Implement refresh token mechanism
   - Store tokens securely (httpOnly cookies preferred)
   - Validate tokens on every request
   - Implement logout that invalidates tokens
   ```

2. **Code Review Focus**:
   - Mandatory security-focused code review
   - Use established libraries (python-jose)
   - Follow OWASP guidelines for JWT

3. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Test token expiration
   - Test invalid token handling
   - Test token refresh flow
   - Penetration testing for auth endpoints

**Success Metrics**:
- Pass security checklist review
- No auth-related vulnerabilities in testing
- Clean security scan results

## Medium Priority Risks

### 3. Performance with Large Datasets (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)

**Risk**: API responses could be slow when handling experiments with 100+ rounds.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   ```python
   # Implementation patterns
   - Implement pagination (20 items default)
   - Add database indexing on common queries
   - Use async/await for all I/O operations
   - Implement response caching with Redis
   - Add compression for large responses
   ```

2. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Add performance logging
   - Set up response time alerts (>500ms)
   - Load test with realistic data volumes

3. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Lazy loading of experiment details
   - Virtual scrolling in frontend
   - Progressive data loading

**Success Metrics**:
- API response time <500ms for 95th percentile
- Frontend remains responsive with 1000+ experiments
- Memory usage stays under 512MB

### 4. Integration Complexity (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)

**Risk**: Integrating with existing DataManager and file structure could reveal unexpected issues.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Early Integration Testing**:
   - Create integration tests in Task 3
   - Test with real experiment data early
   - Handle edge cases (missing files, corrupt JSON)

2. **Abstraction Layer**:
   ```python
   # Create adapter pattern
   class ExperimentDataAdapter:
       def __init__(self, data_manager: DataManager):
           self.data_manager = data_manager
       
       def get_experiments(self) -> List[ExperimentSummary]:
           # Handle data transformation here
           pass
   ```

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation for missing data
   - Clear error messages for debugging
   - Fallback mechanisms

**Success Metrics**:
- Successfully loads all existing experiments
- Handles corrupt/missing data without crashing
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Low Priority Risks

### 5. Browser Compatibility (Probability: Low, Impact: Low)

**Risk**: Modern JavaScript features might not work in older browsers.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Browser Support Policy**:
   - Define minimum supported versions
   - Suggested: Chrome/Edge 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
   - Use Babel for transpilation if needed

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Include browser testing in E2E tests
   - Use BrowserStack for cross-browser testing
   - Progressive enhancement approach

### 6. Deployment Challenges (Probability: Low, Impact: Medium)

**Risk**: No deployment strategy defined could delay production readiness.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Deployment Planning**:
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml structure
   services:
     frontend:
       build: ./dashboard
       ports: ["3000:3000"]
     backend:
       build: ./
       ports: ["8000:8000"]
   ```

2. **Documentation**:
   - Create deployment guide early
   - Document environment variables
   - Include health check endpoints

## Risk Monitoring Plan

### Weekly Risk Review
- [ ] Check story velocity against plan
- [ ] Review security implementation progress
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Assess integration test results

### Risk Escalation Triggers
1. **Immediate Escalation**:
   - Security vulnerability discovered
   - Integration completely blocked
   - Less than 50% tasks complete at mid-sprint

2. **Next Day Escalation**:
   - Performance requirements not met
   - Major browser compatibility issue
   - Deployment blockers identified

### Contingency Plans

1. **If Story Split Required**:
   - Implement predetermined split (7.1a/7.1b)
   - Communicate to stakeholders immediately
   - Adjust Epic 7 timeline accordingly

2. **If Security Issues Found**:
   - Pause feature development
   - Focus team on security fixes
   - Bring in security expert if needed

3. **If Performance Issues Persist**:
   - Consider caching service (Redis)
   - Implement read-only database replica
   - Add CDN for static assets

## Success Criteria

The story will be considered successfully risk-mitigated when:

1. **Development Velocity**: Maintaining 3-4 subtasks completed per day
2. **Security Posture**: All auth tests passing, security review approved
3. **Performance Metrics**: Meeting all defined benchmarks
4. **Integration Success**: Loading real experiment data without errors
5. **Quality Standards**: >80% test coverage, no critical bugs
