# Security Considerations

## API Key Management
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Never committed to version control
- .env file for local development

## Data Privacy
- Agent IDs anonymized between rounds
- No personally identifiable information collected
- Results stored locally only

## Rate Limiting
- Respect API provider limits
- Exponential backoff on errors
- Cost monitoring with $10 limit
