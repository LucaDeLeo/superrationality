# Performance Considerations

## Optimization Strategies
1. **Parallel Strategy Collection**: 10 concurrent API calls per round
2. **Sequential Game Execution**: Avoid rate limiting on decisions
3. **Batch File Writes**: Save all round data at once
4. **Memory Management**: Clear context between rounds

## Scalability Limits
- Maximum 10 agents (PRD requirement)
- Maximum 10 rounds (PRD requirement)
- ~1000 API calls per experiment
- ~100MB storage per experiment
