# Epic 7: Advanced Visualization Dashboard
*Product Requirements Document*

## Epic Overview
**ID**: EPIC-7  
**Title**: Advanced Visualization Dashboard  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High  
**Target Release**: v0.7.0  

## Executive Summary
Create a comprehensive visualization dashboard that enables researchers to explore, analyze, and understand experiment results through interactive charts, graphs, and data views. This dashboard will serve as the primary interface for interpreting the outputs from our transcript analysis, similarity scoring, and decision-making systems.

## Problem Statement
Researchers currently lack a unified interface to visualize and interpret the complex multi-dimensional data generated by our experiments. Raw JSON outputs and log files make it difficult to:
- Identify patterns across multiple experimental runs
- Compare performance between different strategies
- Understand relationships between variables
- Share insights with stakeholders
- Make data-driven decisions about system improvements

## Goals & Objectives
1. **Primary Goal**: Provide an intuitive, interactive dashboard for experiment result visualization
2. **Secondary Goals**:
   - Enable real-time monitoring of running experiments
   - Support data export for external analysis
   - Facilitate hypothesis testing through visual exploration
   - Create shareable reports and insights

## Success Metrics
- Dashboard load time < 2 seconds for typical datasets
- Support visualization of 100+ experimental runs simultaneously
- 90% of researchers can generate insights without technical assistance
- Reduce time to insight from hours to minutes
- Zero data loss or visualization errors

## User Stories Overview
1. **Story 7.1**: Core Dashboard Infrastructure
2. **Story 7.2**: Tournament Visualization Components
3. **Story 7.3**: Transcript Analysis Views
4. **Story 7.4**: Similarity Score Heatmaps
5. **Story 7.5**: Decision Flow Diagrams
6. **Story 7.6**: Performance Metrics Dashboard
7. **Story 7.7**: Export and Reporting Features
8. **Story 7.8**: Real-time Experiment Monitoring

## Technical Requirements
### Frontend
- React-based single-page application
- D3.js or Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

### Backend
- RESTful API for data retrieval
- Efficient data aggregation and caching
- Support for large dataset pagination
- Authentication and authorization

### Data Processing
- Pre-computed aggregations for common queries
- On-demand calculation for custom views
- Efficient storage of visualization-ready data

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Dashboard as independent module
2. **API-First Design**: All data access through defined endpoints
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic views first, advanced features later
4. **Performance First**: Optimize for large datasets from the start

## Dependencies
- Existing experiment output formats (JSON, logs)
- Database schema for result storage
- Authentication system (if applicable)
- Web server infrastructure

## Constraints
- Must work with existing data formats
- Cannot modify core experiment logic
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Limited to read-only operations on experiment data

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays all major experiment metrics
2. Users can filter and drill down into specific results
3. Visualizations update without page refresh
4. Data export maintains full fidelity
5. Performance remains acceptable with large datasets

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-second response for most operations
- **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Security**: Read-only access to experiment data
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Risk**: Large dataset performance issues
   - **Mitigation**: Implement data pagination and lazy loading
2. **Risk**: Browser compatibility issues
   - **Mitigation**: Target modern browsers, provide fallbacks
3. **Risk**: Complex visualization requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Start with MVP, iterate based on feedback

## Timeline Estimate

- Story 7.1 (Infrastructure): 2 weeks
- Stories 7.2-7.6 (Core Features): 4-5 weeks
- Stories 7.7-7.8 (Advanced Features): 2-3 weeks

## Definition of Done
