# Product Requirements Document
## Focused Acausal Cooperation Experiment

### Project Overview
**Project Name:** Acausal Cooperation Experiment  
**Project Type:** Greenfield Research Application  
**Primary Goal:** Test whether identical LLM agents achieve superrational cooperation through recognition of logical correlation in prisoner's dilemma tournaments.

### Executive Summary
A single Python project using a node-based framework to orchestrate API calls and game logic. The experiment runs 10 agents through 10 rounds of prisoner's dilemma tournaments, testing for emergent cooperation patterns among identical AI systems. Outputs JSON files with complete experimental data for analysis.
